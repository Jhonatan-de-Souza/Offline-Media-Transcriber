## 🚀 CPU-Based Transcriber (Recommended)

This is the easiest option. It works on any computer without requiring a GPU.

### Installation

**Step 1: Navigate to the CPU folder**

```bash
cd "CPU Based Audio Transcriber"
```

**Step 2: Create a virtual environment**

macOS / Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Windows (Command Prompt):

```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

**Step 3: Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 4 (Optional): Install FFmpeg for video support**

macOS:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

Ubuntu / Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

Windows:

```bash
choco install ffmpeg
```

### Quick Start

Launch the app:

```bash
python app.py
```

**On first run:**
1. **Download splash screen** — App automatically downloads AI models from Hugging Face (~671MB)
2. **Progress indicator** — Shows download status
3. **Main window** — Ready to transcribe

**Subsequent runs:**
1. **No splash screen** — Models are cached locally, app starts instantly
2. **Loading screen** — App loads the model into memory
3. **Main window** — Ready to transcribe

Then:
1. Click **Browse** and select an audio or video file
2. Click **Transcribe**
3. Watch the countdown timer
4. Results appear automatically

### Supported File Types

**Audio:** MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, OGG, AIFF, AU, and more  
**Video:** MP4, MKV, AVI, MOV, WEBM, FLV, WMV, etc. (auto-converted)

### How It Works

- **Smart time estimation** — App measures your CPU performance on startup
- **Accurate countdown** — Timer shows real remaining time, not guesses
- **Responsive UI** — Never freezes; cancel anytime
- **No language selection** — Model auto-detects what you're speaking

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

```
1. Select file
  ↓
2. App measures CPU speed (5-second benchmark)
  ↓
3. Calculate: estimated_time = file_duration × your_cpu_speed
  ↓
4. Transcribe with accurate countdown
  ↓
5. Show results
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### CPU Version

#### "Module not found: sherpa_onnx"

**Cause:** Dependencies not installed in virtual environment  
**Solution:**

```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### "FFmpeg not found" (video files not working)

**Cause:** FFmpeg not installed on your system  
**Solution:**

macOS:

```bash
# Install Homebrew first if needed: https://brew.sh
brew install ffmpeg
```

Ubuntu / Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

Windows:

```bash
# Option 1: Using Chocolatey (requires admin)
choco install ffmpeg

# Option 2: Manual download
# 1. Visit https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
# 2. Download Windows build
# 3. Extract to C:\ffmpeg
# 4. Add C:\ffmpeg\bin to PATH
```

#### "Model files not found"

**Cause:** Models are missing or in wrong location  
**Solution:**

```bash
# Check if models exist
ls models/

# Should show:
# encoder.int8.onnx
# decoder.int8.onnx
# joiner.int8.onnx
# tokens.txt

# If missing, you may need to re-clone the repository
```

#### Countdown timer seems wrong

**Cause:** CPU performance measurement may vary between runs  
**Solution:** Subsequent runs will provide better accuracy as the app learns your system performance.

### GPU Version

#### GPU not detected

**Cause:** Either no NVIDIA GPU, or CUDA not installed  
**Solution:**

```bash
# Check if you have an NVIDIA GPU
nvidia-smi

# If command not found, you need NVIDIA drivers
# Download from: https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverDetails.aspx

# After installing drivers, reinstall PyTorch
pip uninstall torch torchvision
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```

#### "CUDA out of memory"

**Cause:** Your GPU doesn't have enough VRAM  
**Solution:** Switch to CPU-based version or reduce batch size

```bash
# Use CPU instead
cd ../CPU\ Based\ Audio\ Transcriber
python app.py
```

#### Model loading hangs

**Cause:** First download taking too long (Whisper model needs to download)  
**Solution:** Be patient. Check internet connection. It's a one-time download.

```bash
# Check if it's downloading (on Windows, check Task Manager)
# Check if it's downloading (on Mac, check Activity Monitor)
# Check if it's downloading (on Linux, run: watch -n 1 'du -sh ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/')
```

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

### CPU Version: Change Model Path

Edit `config.py`:

```python
MODEL_CONFIG = {
   "encoder_path": "./models/encoder.int8.onnx",  # ← Path to encoder
   "decoder_path": "./models/decoder.int8.onnx",
   "joiner_path": "./models/joiner.int8.onnx",
   "tokens_path": "./models/tokens.txt",
}
```

### Performance Tuning

**CPU Version:**
- Close other applications for best results
- System load will affect transcription speed

**GPU Version:**

**Q: Does it work on Mac with Apple Silicon?**  
A: Yes, the CPU version works on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3).

**Q: Can I batch transcribe with CPU version?**  
A: Not in the UI, but you can run multiple instances.

**Q: Can I improve transcription accuracy?**  
A: Use clear audio and minimize background noise for best results.
